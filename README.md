## What How Game ?

umm basically a game where there are a either a bunch of preselected question which the players need to answer like
`what would x do in y situation ?` and
the answers by all the players are diasplayed and people vote on it (it can be either anonymous or not (depends on what the game admin selects))
and there will be multiple rounds of this
and whoever with the maxiumum points at the end wins the game
